S  Introduction

=H Intro

 . PresGen is a bunch of Python scripts used to create presentations out of a simple text format.
 . Currently supported formats are PowerPoint, PythonPoint (part of reportlab) and LaTeX's Beamer format.

=H History

 . I started developing PresGen a couple of years ago when dealing with quite inconsistent PowerPoint presentations without proper style files / templates.
 . So I searched for a simple text format to ease working with presentations and the ability to apply consistent formatting to it.
 . 'Python Programming on Win32' proved to be of great help for this in introducing me to ReportLab with PythonPoint and the handling of PowerPoint via Python and COM.


S  Text Format Description

=H Structure
 - The presentation is structured in a simple textformat
 - The first three columns contain formatting and structuring information
 - Contents starts beginning with column four
 - The presentation is structured into sections containing slides which contain paragraphs

=H Structure-2
 - Commentlines are those starting with '#' in column one
 - Comments at the end of a line are not supported (yet)

 - Column 1 contains section information (I, P, S, =), with the exception of 'r', which signifies the content of the right column when using two-column output


=H Column 1
 - 'I' introduces a section to be ignored, whereas '=I' introduces a slide to ignore

 - 'P' starts the preamble, i.e. information about the presentation

 - 'S' starts a section

 - '#' starts a comment line

 - '=' is used in conjunction with column 2
 -- '=I' introduces a slide to be ignored
 -- '=H' introduces the header of a slide


=H Column 2 (Paragraph Styles)

 - ' - ' Bulletpoint Level 1
 - ' --' Bulletpoint Level 2
 - ' . ' Text
 - '   ' Continuation line (i.e. first three columns empty, i.e. filled with spaces)
 - ' > ' Indented text
 - ' g ' include graphics file
 - ' n ' A note for handouts; not implemented properly yet


=H Two-Column Mode
 - Two-column mode is entered when 'r' is used for text to appear in the right hand column
r. This should appear in the second column


=H How to create my own presentation
 . It is assumed that you put your own presentation in a directory inside of presentations.
 > You may copy the contents of presentations/Documentation as a template.
 . Makefile and bin/Makefile.defs assume with their relative paths this directory structure.
 . If PRESGEN_HOME is set, your presentation may reside outside of PresGen. If you stay with make,
   you should check their relative paths.
 . At the moment, iso-8859-1 is assumed as the encoding used for all presentations.


=H Error Handling

 . There is very little error handling yet.
   E.g. if an unsupported presentation format is used, the application simply crashes with a stack trace pointing out the error.


S  Setup

=H Beamer
 . Beamer presentation style is usually included in a TeX distribution.
 . Beware: You have to be careful with specific characters, as these are not yet properly masked for use within LaTeX!
 . Currently only '#', '$' and '_' are handled.


=H PythonPoint
 . PythonPoint comes with reportlab.
 . You need to setup system variable PYTHON_DIST_PACKAGES, e.g.
 c export PYTHON_DIST_PACKAGES=/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
 . in your .bashrc or
 c PYTHON_DIST_PACKAGES=c:/Python15/Lib/site-packages
 . under Windows.

=H PythonPoint
 . I explicitely use slashes here instead of backslashes so this will work in conjunction with cygwin,
   where I don't have installed Python so that I always use the same Python.
 . Furthermore you need to copy the tools folder from the reportlab
   distribution into this folder, because neither is the tools folder installed automatically
   nor do the files inside contain the reportlab prefix in their references.


=H PowerPoint
 . You need a PowerPoint version pre 2007 (tested with 2000 and 2003).
 . You need a Python distribution like the one from ActiveState containing the Windows extensions.
# . With Python 2.5 ...
 . Put a PowerPoint template in the CompanySpecifics folder and reference this in the
   appropriate Makefile as POWERPOINT_TEMPLATE (see example in presentations/Documentation)
 . POWERPOINT_TEMPLATE may be empt too.

=H Tested Platforms
 - Windows XP
 -- PowerPoint 2000/03
 -- cygwin
 -- AvtiveState Python 2.5
 -- ReportLab 2.5
 -- MiKTeX 2.7 / 2.8 / 2.9

 - Ubuntu 10.04
 -- Python 2.7
 -- ReportLab 2.3
 -- (La)TeX (texlive)

=H Tested Platforms (2)
 - Mac OS X
 -- (La)TeX
 -- Python 2.6 / 2.7

=H Test After Set-up
 . Enter presgen/presentations/Documentation.
 - PythonPoint: make pdf-en
 - PowerPoint: make ppt-en
 - Beamer: make beamer-en

S  Further Development

=H Next Steps
 - Proper refactoring to make structure and intent much clearer
 - Internationalization
 - Make it possible to include (complicated) slides (mainly for PowerPoint)
 - Estimate effort for including support for Open/Libre Office Impress
 -- is support feasible with current infrastructure?
 - Support different encodings

=H PowerPoint 2007 and up
 . Find out, what to change.
 . Didn't manage on first try, because Microsoft changed object model while at the same time removing the macro recorder from PowerPoint.
